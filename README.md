# Quiz-Game

* This is a quick and simple Quiz-Game that I made over a weekend.

* I built this site from scratch using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Javascript.

* This quiz game site is live on github pages.

* This was an assignment for my Full Stack Web Development course, but how we designed it, the questions, the functionality of the game, was all done by me.

* There was no pre-defined code that I had to use.


This project was my most challenging project to date. It stretched me in every way possible, but it especially stretched me in my knowledge of Javascript. There were a couple of hiccups here and there, but for the most part I had fun building this game!

Down the road I'd like to come back to this game and add different sets of questions to it, but for right now I'm happy with where the game is at! Hopefully you'll have fun with it too!
